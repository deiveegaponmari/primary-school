          Our Pre-Primary programme is designed to provide children with a
          joyful and meaningful learning experience. Through stories, play,
          songs, hands-on activities, and guided exploration, children develop
          early literacy, numeracy, fine motor skills, and social behaviour. We
          create a warm and caring environment where every child feels safe,
          confident, and happy to learn.
